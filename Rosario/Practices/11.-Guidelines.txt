GUIDELINES SUGESTIONS
1.- Format (int, float, string)
	- Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation.
2.- Classes:
	- Avoid the usage of class (@@) variables due to their "nasty" behavior in inheritance.
	- Use def self.method to define singleton methods.
3.- Methods:
	- Use def with parentheses only when there 	are parameters.
	- Avoid methods with a single-line.
	- Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis
	- Avoid return where not required.
4.- Variables, Getter/Setter
	- Use the Getter method to access to any variable.
	- Use the Setter method to access to any variable.
	- Use the methods defined by Ruby to access to any variable
5.- If condition:
	- Never use then for multi-line if/unless
	- Never use unless with else. Rewrite these with the positive case first
	- Avoid unless with multiple conditions
	- Don't use parentheses around the condition of an 	if/unless/while
